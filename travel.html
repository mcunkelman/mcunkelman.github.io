                <h1>Map of my trip</h1>
                <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1ltHO5S258DB7ukIHKwXd-7s3kzVlVg4h"></iframe>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    As someone who isn’t the biggest fan of flying (apparently wanting to open a window for some fresh air “Isn’t a good idea”), this trip seemed to take longer than the alleged 30 hours my plane ticket says it did. 
                    I think during all the date- and time-zone changes, about a week of my life is still unaccounted for. 
                    We flew from PIttsburgh to Phoenix, and then to Los Angeles, where we made a stop in the lounge to have a drink and some dinner. 
                    Luckily Zannah, my wonderful girlfriend and travel companion on this adventure, had managed to get us upgraded to business class. 
                    This was greatly appreciated on the 17 hour flight from LAX to Sydney. 
                    The flight was smooth, and being able to lay down certainly made it more comfortable. 
                    Nevertheless, I was still very happy when I saw land appear again as we began our descent. 
                    We landed in Sydney, I got to cross off another continent from the list of ones I had not yet visited, and the adventure truly began.
                </p>
                <h1>Day 1</h1>
                <p>
                    We left the airport and hailed a cab to take us to our hotel (it was not until later we learned about the convenient train that could have taken us for far cheaper, 
                    and avoided all the traffic). 
                    We checked into the hotel and dropped our bags in the room and showered. 
                    We wanted to do some exploring in and around Sydney, and replace my carry on bag that had ripped while carrying it through LAX. 
                    We grabbed a quick lunch and took a double decker bus North towards Palm Beach and Governor Phillip Park, with the Barrenjoey Lighthouse. 
                    We got off the bus near the park, and walked along the beach towards the northern tip of the point, where the lighthouse sat on top of the hill. 
                    We hiked up and around, and enjoyed being able to move about after being on a plane for 2 days. 
                    We stopped at a small Fish and Chips shop on the way back for some food, and then took a bus to the Manly Wharf, where we took the ferry back to our hotel on Circular Quay. 
                    The ferry took us past the Sydney Opera House, and under the Bay Bridge. 
                    We made it back and had a quick dinner in the outdoor market at Belles Hot Chicken (it was fantastic) before heading to bed.
                </p>
                <h1>Day 2</h1>
                <p>
                    We woke up and had a delicious breakfast at the hotel, before heading to the Westfield Mall to look for a new bag for me. 
                    I found a nice goatskin leather bag, and got to enjoy a very favorable exchange rate while purchasing it. 
                    We walked along the outdoor market at the wharf to find somewhere to have lunch. 
                    We settled on The Meat District because they had kangaroo on the menu and I wanted to try it (it tasted very similar to beef honestly). 
                    After lunch I needed a nap, as I still was not fully adjusted to the 16 hour time change, and we had evening plans. 
                    So, we headed back to the hotel for a while. We then walked around Sydney to the Botanical Gardens before getting ready for our show at the Sydney Opera House. 
                    We had purchased tickets to a play called “Assassins” at The Playhouse in the Sydney Opera House. We took a few pictures while there, and then headed in to see the show. 
                    It was a comical recounting of all the assassinations and attempted assassinations of U.S. presidents. 
                    We enjoyed it, but we were very tired after (and maybe a little during) the show, so we then headed back to the hotel for bed. 
                </p>
                <h1>Day 3</h1>     
                <p>
                    We woke up early, and finished packing and showered before grabbing boxed breakfasts from the hotel lobby. 
                    Now a little smarter, we took the train back to the airport, where we took advantage of Zannah’s travel card and status to have a second complimentary breakfast. 
                    There were several delays, but we finally boarded Air New Zealand for Auckland. 
                    We arrived, and grabbed the rental car (I got stuck learning to drive on the wrong side of the car in the rain), and headed to the hotel. 
                    We checked in and asked about dinner recommendations. 
                    Shockingly, they actually suggested Joe’s Crab Shack. 
                    But we decided that we didn’t want something we could have anytime back in Pittsburgh, so we chose Dr. Rudi’s Rooftop Brewery. 
                    We had a delicious dinner before heading back to the hotel to get our bearings and go to sleep. 
                </p>
                <h1> Day 4</h1>
                <p>
                    Zannah woke up very excited, since we were heading to Hobbiton today to explore the set of where The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit were filmed. 
                    It was a really cool experience. 
                    Since most of the movies used practical effects, there was a lot to actually see. 
                    I definitely think anyone who is a fan should check it out. 
                    After we finished our tour of Hobbiton, we headed to Rotorua for lunch at the Pig Whistle and to stretch our legs. 
                    We dipped our feet into some of the hot springs there and then headed to the “Buried Village”. 
                    It was a small settlement that was overcome by a volcanic eruption in 1886 (the same eruption also destroyed the white terraces, a former Natural Wonder in New Zealand). 
                    The village has been partially excavated and has some hiking trails around, so we hiked and explored until it began to get dark. 
                    We then headed to the overlook, to see the volcano responsible for the destruction, before heading on to the hotel in Lake Taupo. 
                </p>
                    
                        
                    Day 5:
                        Woke up and had breakfast at the hotel, and received a few recommendations from the staff as far as things to do in Lake Taupo. They suggested Huka falls and the water release at Aratiatia Dam. We made our way to the falls first, but heavy fog limited visibility. Not letting this one setback stop us, we went to check out the water release. We are so glad we did! They open the flood gates several times a day at the dam and release an impressive amount of water. As engineers, we enjoyed it. We then drove down towards Mt. Tongariro National Park to do some hiking on a volcano. The hike was incredible. It started in an almost temperate rainforest at the base of the volcano before the trail wound its way upward. As as it did, the rainforest gave way to scraggly underbrush, and then to more open and treeless grasslands. Finally, we climbed above all the plants, and continued hiking through a very rocky and snow covered terrain. During all of this, my watch told me it recorded the equivalent of walking up 185 flights of stairs. We eventually reached a point where we needed to turn back in order to make it back to the car before dark. If I were to go back, I think I would attempt to do the entire Alpine Crossing track. After we made it back to the car, we began the long drive down to Wellington. We arrived at the hotel late and exhausted, and headed straight to bed. 

                    Day 6:
                        We were up early to return the rental car, and board the ferry, which was huge. The Cook Strait crossing takes several hours, but the ferry had lots of options. We had breakfast and coffee, and explored the boat. We spent some time outside looking at the spectacular views, but were forced indoors several times due to very strong winds. The ferry crossed the open strait, and then wound its way between islands and small fingers of land to Picton. Once there, we picked up our new rental car and headed towards Greymouth on the West coast, where we would be staying that evening. We rented an AirBnB, which was actually a tiny house! Our host, Joy, had the tiny house in her backyard. She was very nice and offered to do our laundry for us. Our tiny house was was very clean and cozy, and there was a loaf of fresh homemade bread and some jams waiting for us. We chatted with Joy and she recommended a place in town for dinner, where we went and then returned and headed to bed. 

                    Day 7:
                    We woke up to clean clothes and the sound of Joy feeding her sheep and chickens. We headed into town for a quick breakfast, and then began the long and scenic drive across the Southern Alps to Christchurch via Arthur’s Pass. It was a beautiful drive, winding up and through the mountains, with several great photo opportunities. Along the way, we stopped at the Otira Viaduct and saw several Keas. The Kea is the only alpine parrot in the world and it is nearly extinct. We then stopped at the Otira Valley track, hiked up the valley for a bit, and took in some more spectacular views before continuing on our way. Our next stop was at the Devil’s Punchbowl waterfall for another quick hike, and even more views. We continued on our way, and finally arrived in Christchurch, where we checked into the hotel and headed to dinner. We headed back to the hotel and off to bed. 

                    Day 8:
                        We were up and out early today, so we could go and look for penguins around Robinson’s Bay and Akaroa. The drive isn’t far, but it covers some of the steepest and twistiest roads I have ever driven on. As we made our way around the bay into Akaroa, we stopped along the beach and talked a couple collecting seaweed for their garden. We asked then if they knew where we might find the penguins and they suggested Flea Bay, so we looked it up on the map and headed that way. The drive was gorgeous, and only slightly reminded me that I am still in fact, slightly afraid of heights. The road turned to gravel and narrowed as we got closer to our destination, until it suddenly ended at a gate. The sign said it was closed for the season. Zannah was not pleased to miss the penguins, and I was unhappy about having to reverse back up the steep, narrow, and winding road. I eventually found a spot to turn around and we stopped to regroup and come up with a new plan. We had passed several forks in the road, and so now we looked at the map to see if any of them showed more promise. We decided on one of the nearby bays that showed the road continuing all the way to the sea. We drove over towards it, and the road seemed to pass right through a farm. We were worried we were driving up someone's driveway, until we saw signs and a carpark next to a small trailhead sign. We parked and realized the trail set off through a sheep pasture, with a gate and sign, asking everyone to make sure they closed the gate behind them. The trail wound down past a small lighthouse, with some explanatory information. After reading the placard, we set off down a set of tracks towards the small cove, and had a few sheep companions walking with us. The trail kept winding down and around the hillside. It was quite muddy, until we reached the end of the trail. It was so beautiful, we stayed for a while and took pictures and kept looking for penguins. We still did not see any penguins, so we began to walk all the way up the hill, back to the car. We drove back through Akaroa, and stopped for some fresh fish and chips, before continuing back to the hotel in Christchurch. When we made it back and I began doing more research to find Zannah penguins. We found out about a nature preserve in Dunedin that did twilight penguin tours. So we decided to revise the plans for the following day, to make time for that. 

                    Day 9:
                        We were up and early again, to begin the long drive to Dunedin. Our plan for today had been to head to Twizel and do the Hooker Valley Track towards Mt. Cook, but Dunedin was going to take up most of the day. I wasn’t completely upset about this, as Dunedin has another interesting feature. Depending on how you define the word “street,” the steepest street in the world is either Canton Ave, in Pittsburgh (which I have been to), or Baldwin St, in Dunedin, NZ. When we made it down we headed straight to Baldwin St. The signs indicate that there is no turn around at the top, and should only be driven up by non-residents (grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr). The street is certainly steep, and in my opinion, is more deserving than Canton Ave of the title. It was kind of cool in a nerdy way and I am glad that I have had the chance to see both of the steepest streets in the world. We then made our way to the Royal Albatross Centre, to hopefully finally find some penguins! The drive was another beautiful but twisty road along the coast, out to the very tip of the peninsula. When we arrived, we ventured inside and sought the information desk. They explained the guided tours, and we realized that this was how New Zealand handled wildlife conservation. They let companies manage the wildlife and its habitat, and earn money from visitors to continue operate. Personally I think they do this very well, and I think the Royal Albatross Center is a great example. We signed up for a combo package of tours: the guided tour to see the baby albatrosses (and maybe the parents), followed by the disappearing gun, and finally the penguins after dark. Our tickets were glow in the dark green wrist bands, I still wear mine today. We had a little time to kill before the tours began, so we wandered through the gift shop and bought some penguin related souvenirs, and a basket of fries to snack on. The tour began by taking us into a small theater and explaining the geography and history of the little peninsula we were on, as well as how and why the albatross came to nest here. After that, we went up the hill and into the underground viewing point. There were several chicks sitting in the nests! Our guide explained that at this point, the parents only come back once every few days to feed the chicks since they were getting close to leaving on their own. We were fortunate enough to actually see 2 of the parents fly in and land. They are huge and not very graceful, with wingspans of over 10 feet. They chose the peninsula because it is shaped in such a way that they can always takeoff downhill into the wind, and land (more like crash land) into the wind. The underground viewing point was part of an old fort used to protect New Zealand from invasion, and included the big disappearing gun. It is a rather ingenious solution: mounting what is essentially a cannon, on a hydraulic platform that can be raised above ground to fire, before dropping back out of sight. We moved throughout the system of tunnels to see more of the fort and more of the albatrosses before heading back down to the main building to wait for dusk. Once it began to get dark, we headed down the walkway to the beach. The center has installed raised platforms with backlighting to allow optimal penguin viewing. These are the Blue Penguins, and they are the smallest species of penguin in the world. We waited quietly, until they began emerging from the ocean in small groups. They would walk up the beach, under the platforms, and continue into the grassy hillside where their burrows are. This went on for a while and we got lots of pictures, until they turned the lights off. That was when we noticed the stars. It was unbelievable to look up and see them all, so clearly. We still had a long drive to the overnight spot, in Twizel, so we got going. Twizel is away from the coast, in the Southern Alps, and is also in one of the dark skies preserves. That means there is relatively little light pollution, making it a perfect spot to see the stars. When we got to the cabin we were staying at, Zannah was a good sport and agreed to come outside and take pictures of the sky, even though it was freezing cold. We finally went to bed late that evening.

                    Day 10:
                        We woke up to foggy and rainy conditions, not ideal for the hike we had planned. We went into town and got breakfast, and then began to drive further into the mountains towards the Hooker Valley Track. The drive was incredible, we drove along a lake full of erie blue water. I think the color came from the minerals and low oxygen content. We passed fields of mountain lilac, the Sir Edmund Hillary Alpine Centre, and more beautiful scenery. When we arrived at the start of the track, it was still foggy, raining, windy, and cold. We decided to do the hike regardless, so we layered up and headed off. The hike was fun, but we were quickly soaked through and freezing cold. Every time we came to a bridge, and heard the thunder echoing in the valley, we walked a little quicker. We did make it all the way to the end, where you can look out across the lake and see the glacier coming down from Mt. Cook. Unfortunately, all we saw was fog. This is another place I would like to do again if I ever go back to New Zealand. We headed back, dried off, and changed into fresh clothes so we could begin to warm up. We then got back in the car and began the drive to Queenstown, where we arrived after dark. We hung our clothes up to dry and went to dinner, before turning in to bed. 

                    Day 11:
                        We had a very slow morning, and spent a lot of time using the hotel hair dryer, trying to dry out our shoes. We made our way over to the gondola to head up the mountain. It was raining in Queenstown, but halfway up the mountain it switched to snow, and we could see all the ski resorts. At the top we got out and explored a bit, before sitting down to decide what we wanted to do next. We decided since a lot of our hiking gear was still wet, we would instead look to go for a drive. We saw the weather forecast showed that Milford Sound would be clear for sunset, so that was where we decided to go. Milford Sound is relatively close to Queenstown (~40 miles in a straight line), but the road winds its way out around the mountains so to drive it is almost 180 miles. It was another beautiful drive, and we stopped several times to take pictures along the way. Since we stopped along the way, we were in a slight rush to get to Milford Sound in time. Unfortunately, this is when we learned that speed limits in New Zealand are actual limits. I came home with a souvenir I had not intended to get, a speeding ticket. We finally arrived at Milford Sound just a few minutes before sunset. To get to the sound, you have to drive through a 1-lane tunnel through a mountain, and the sound opens up in front of you. It was incredible. We walked around a bit and looked for the best place to get pictures of the scenery. Watching the sunset there was awesome, and we got several fantastic pictures of it. After the sunset, we headed back to the hotel for bed, stopping for dinner on the way. 

                    Day 12:
                        We were up and out early, we had several things we wanted to do before heading to the airport. We set off for Wanaka, to see the Wanaka tree in the lake via Crown Range road. The road wound up through the mountains, and was very icy, but the scenery was beautiful. We arrived in Wanaka, and found the tree growing out in the lake with a beautiful mountain backdrop. We grabbed a few pictures and went to find some lunch and headed back towards Queenstown. We dropped off the car and got checked in for our flight, then headed to the lounge. The flight back to Sydney went smoothly, and we took the train back to our hotel. We arrived to find they had upgraded us to a suite. We had a final meal at Belle’s Hot Chicken and headed to bed. 

                    Day 13:
                        We were up and out, heading back to the airport to begin the long journey home. Luckily we were upgraded again to business class for the long flight from Sydney to LA. We landed in LA 3 hours before our flight left Sydney, you have got to love the international date line! We were time travelers. We went through customs before once again taking advantage of Zannah’s travel perks by heading to the lounge to shower. The shower was a great way to make me feel more human after so much time on a plane. Then we flew to Chicago, and were upgraded again for the final flight into Pittsburgh (all 51 minutes of it). Then we were home. It was a great trip!

                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is my account of my trip to Iceland in September, 2017. 
                    I had talked about going for several years, but I finally decided to pull the trigger and go, and I am so glad I did. 
                    I am going to try to be a bit more descriptive of this adventure than I was of the Alaska trip.
                </p>

                <h1>Day 1</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I flew overnight from Pittsburgh into Keflavík International Airport, just outside of Reykjavík, Iceland at 5:30 AM. 
                    Upon landing, I made the mistake of leaving the airport without getting anything to eat. 
                    I soon learned that Iceland is not like the U.S, in that most things are not open 24 hrs/day or on weekends. 
                    I took a bus to the rental car agency and picked up the Jeep Wrangler with a manual transmission (only certain rental companies will allow their cars on Iceland's F roads), 
                    and headed into Reykjavik to find breakfast. 
                    I stopped at the geothermal beach on the way but it wasn’t open, and I was tired and hungry. 
                    In Reykjavik I found a small cafe that opened at 7 for a quick breakfast (this was my first exposure to food prices in Iceland). 
                    After breakfast I took a scenic route through downtown and headed to the hotel for that night. 
                    After settling into the hotel, I went for a little drive to begin exploring for a few hours (and maybe a nap). 
                    That afternoon I had scheduled a snorkeling tour in the Silfra fissure between the North American and European tectonic plates. 
                    The water was 30 degrees, and was fed from glacier melt. The water melted off the glacier and then flowed through volcanic rock into the fissure, 
                    meaning the water was very cold but also extremely clear, with visibility over 100 meters. Due to the constant melt, 
                    there is a slow current that gently pushed you through the fissure.
                    The site is also where the Althing occurred, which is the oldest parliament in the world (founded 930 AD). 
                    It was then time to head back to the hotel for dinner and bed.
                </p> 
                <h1>Day 2</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I woke up and headed to breakfast, and enjoyed chatting with a family from the UK. 
                    I then headed North to the Glymur Waterfall, which is quite a hike, but is the second highest waterfall in Iceland at 198m tall. 
                    Along the way I made some friends from the midwestern US (more about them later). 
                    The hike starts close to sea level and you climb up one side, and wade across the river above the falls to descend the other side. 
                    The hike took most of the day and it was late by the time I arrived in Ólafsvík to that night’s hotel.
                </p>
                <h1>Day 3</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I awoke and set off into Snæfellsjökull National Park, which was a beautiful volcanic landscape to find some F roads to try out. 
                    I ended up driving the Wrangler up the face of a mountain and to the face of a glacier. 
                    The glacier was making its own weather, creating gale force winds coming off the mountain, driving rain and sleet to where I could barely stand up. 
                    It was a very cool experience. After descending from the mountain, I had a long drive to the next overnight spot, but took time to stop at “The mountain that looks like an arrowhead” 
                    (another Game of Thrones location). 
                    I did have to skip the Western Fjordlands, which I do hope to someday go back and visit. 
                    The overnight location that night was one of my favorites of the trip. 
                    I was in Akureyri, and met the hotel owners grandson Guddi, and 2 men from Estonia (who spoke no English or Icelandic). 
                    We stayed up until the early morning conversing by a combination of pictionary, sign language and Google translate. It was a lot of fun.
                </p>
                <h1>Day 4</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I woke up and had a late breakfast, before heading out. 
                    I had decided to head north on one of the small F roads to the Northern Coast to put my feet in the Arctic Ocean. 
                    It was another beautiful drive, and after getting my feet wet, I headed to Lake Myvatn via Goðafoss Waterfall 
                    (which doesn’t quite live up to the name when compared to others). 
                    I stopped at the hotel and then headed to Grjótagjá Cave followed by Hverfjall, an extinct volcano you can hike up and around the Caldera. 
                    Here I again ran into my friends from the midwestern US. 
                    I had a delicious dinner in a barn (the cows were being milked in the next room, I opted for the Lamb). 
                    After dinner I went to the Mývatn Nature Baths, to soak in the hot springs.
                </p>
                <h1>Day 5</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This was a long day that covered some of the toughest roads I have ever encountered. 
                    I headed South into Vatnajökull National Park with the intent of reaching Lake Viti in the Askja Crater. 
                    This is a geothermically heated lake, in the crater of a dormant volcano. 
                    However before I left, I stopped at a information station, there I found out that because of an earthquake/mudslide/tsunami combination the water had chilled. 
                    I was informed of a recent lava flow that was very cool in the same area, so I decided to see that instead. 
                    The road was incredibly rough, and the terrain was otherworldly. 
                    I felt like I was driving on the moon. Everything was grey, but after several hours and a few river crossings, the ground turned to a soft yellow sand. 
                    As I entered the park I came across a small hut and a girl approached from the side of the road, she was welcoming me to the park and asked where I was from. 
                    “Pittsburgh” received a quizzical response, as did “Pennsylvania.” when I finally said the United States, she proclaimed that “We don’t get many Americans here.” 
                    She walked a few steps away and came back with a few large pieces of the yellow sand I had been driving through, and revealed that it was in fact pumice, the rock that floats. 
                    She gave me a few pieces and told me to stay on the roads (Iceland is very relaxed about many things, driving off roads is not one of them) and to enjoy the park. 
                    I continued along to the ranger station, and stopped there to talk to the rangers, who gave my directions to the lava flow, and told me a little more about it. 
                    They said the volcano under the glacier had erupted and that lava had flowed under the glacier and had diverted a river. 
                    They drive down was unique, the road quickly turned to 2 tracks through deep volcanic sand, essentially rendering the steering wheel useless. 
                    The terminal face of the lava flow was impressive, the lava wasn’t just on top of the ground, but you could see where it had pushed the ground down several feet, and had moved some of the bedrock. 
                    I could also see the shape of the lava, it was sharp and covered in hardened splatters and air pockets. 
                    It was then time to head back to the next overnight spot, I had booked a different hotel in the same area. 
                    On the way back I stopped at the ranger station again. The information station I had stopped at before heading down had advised me to take a longer route to avoid a deep water crossing, but the rangers said I should be fine in vehicle I had. 
                    They were ultimately correct, but the water was quite a bit deeper than I had thought. 
                    The water ended up being about 6 inches above the bottom of the door. 
                    That night when I reached the hotel, I finally asked the receptionist where all the workers lived, there were too many hotels and not enough houses to explain it. 
                    She told me that most of the staff lived in the hotels, and that it was a lot of seasonal work.
                </p>
                <h1>Day 6</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The following day I woke up and began a long day of driving. 
                    In hindsight, I would skip the eastern coast if I visited again. 
                    It was still beautiful, but not to the level of the rest of the country. 
                    The one highlight was Dettifoss, the most powerful waterfall in Europe. 
                    If I were to visit again, I would have spent more time in the highlands and gone straight down from Lake Myvatn towards Hof, through the park.
                </p>
                <h1> Day 7</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I woke up and headed to the ice lagoon and ice beach and the black sands beach. 
                    After spending some time there I continued along the Southern coast past Eyjafjallajökull (the volcano that caused havoc for air traffic in europe in 2010). 
                    I ended the day at Geysir, the geyser that all others are named for.
                </p>
                <h1>Day 8</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I woke up and began to travel back to the airport, thus ending this great adventure.
                </p>

                    We (my Dad and I) landed in the Anchorage International Airport,
                where we were met by my Uncle Dean who lives in Alaska.
                We then went and picked up the RV we would be using for this adventure.
                From Anchorage we went North to Willow, AK (where my uncle has his cabin),
                and we spent the first night there.
                The following day we went out on 4x4's on some trails and visited the Goose Creek Tower
                (also called the Dr. Seuss House) and had some spectacular views of Denali in the distance.
                The following day we continued North,
                past Talkeetna (it's really fun to say) and Cantwell to one of the entrance into McKinley Park.
                The road was open all the way to the Savage River.
                While in the park we did see several moose,
                and ran into some people who said a bear had charged their car
                (luckily we didn't have any issues like that). We then headed back South to Cantwell,
                and spent the night camping along side the road.
                The following morning we began crossing the Denali Highway, which was really just a gravel road.
                What the road lacked in, well, road-ness (it apparently is a perfectly acceptable place to land a helicopter though),
                it made up for in views. This is one of the most peaceful places I have ever been.
                We stopped several times for small excursions (and picking the huckleberries that were everywhere)
                We eventually reached Paxson, and then headed North past Summit Lake, and into an unused campground.
                We did some hiking there without fully realizing just how long it stayed light out there.
                At 11:30pm I thought it was still mid-afternoon.
                The following day we headed South to Glennallen and then West to the Eureka Lodge for a
                25 cent cup of coffee and some giant cinnamon rolls.
                We continued West to the Matanuska Glacier
                (a privately owned glacier that is open to explore).
                We spent most of the afternoon hiking out onto the glacier,
                and it was simultaneously one of the coolest and most terrifying things I have ever done,
                I don’t know that I would ever do it again, but I highly recommend everyone should try it.
                We then headed back through Anchorage (and saw a still operation Blockbuster)
                and out onto the Kenai Peninsula all the way to the Homer Spit.
                We were walking around the shops out on the dock when the earthquake hit,
                a M 6.2 across the bay. To us it was only a slight roll in the ground,
                at first I thought a boat had hit the dock, until I realized I was standing on the ground,
                and people on both docks were looking around
                (My uncle head later that people further away in Fairbanks had felt the ground move for almost 2 minutes).
                We spent the night there, and the next day headed back up the coast to do some fishing
                (the salmon were running).
                We met up with a co-worker of my dads and spent the afternoon fishing in the pouring rain.
                I managed to catch one that we later grilled and ate
                (to this day, no "fresh" salmon has ever come close).
                We headed back to Anchorage the next day to catch our flight home.
                It was quite an adventure, and this little blurb doesn’t quite do it justice.
