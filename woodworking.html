        <h1>
            This page will be dedicated to some of my woodworking projects. 
        </h1>
        <p>
            During the pandemic I began looking for small improvements I could make around the house. 
            I was having so much fun, that it branched into a fun hobby that I have quite enjoyed. 
            I started by making a small cage to keep my dog Archer out of our compost bin, 
            but then I got more tools and have found many ways to use them. 
            Some of the projects I have taken on so far are:
        </p>
        <div id="wood">
            <p>
                <img title="Compost Cage" src="./images/woodworking/Compost_Cage.JPG" alt="Compost Cage Picture">
                <h1>Compost Cage</h1>
                    My dog, Archer, was very interested in the compost bin, so we tried piling bricks and stones around it. 
                    He just knocked them over, so I decided to build something sturdier. 
                    This was the simple and quick solution I came up with to keep him out, while allowing us humans access. 
            </p>

            <img title="Bathroom Cabinet" src="./images/woodworking/Bathroom_Cabinet.JPG" alt="Bathroom Cabinet Picture">
            <h1>Bathroom Cabinet</h1>
                My next project was for Z. She wanted a little cabinet for our first floor half bath. 
                So I designed and built this and hung it on the wall. It's a pine box with poplar doors and top. 
            </p>

            <img title="Solid Cherry Desktop" src="./images/woodworking/Desk.jpg" alt="Desk Picture">
            <h1>Solid Cherry Desktop</h1>
                Working from home meant that I needed a better desk. Uber allowed me to purchase a sit / stand deskframe,
                but I wanted to make the top myself. I found S3S cherry on sale and used the table saw to finish the boards. 
                I joined them and sanded them smooth, before applying a tung oil finish. It's 5.5 feet long by 31 inches deep. 
            </p>

            <h1>Little Free Library</h1>
                This was a birthday present for Z. 
                She always loved seeing these around the neighborhood, so I decided to make one for her.  
                I spent a lot of time designing this, since it would be loaded with books and have to support the weight. 
                I also wanted a see-through door, to make it more welcoming. 
                I ended up making the body from pine, and bolting it to the brick wall of the porch. 
                The door is a pine frame with a piece of clear plexiglass for the window.

            <img title="Garage Door" src="./images/woodworking/door.jpg" alt="Garage Door Picture">
            <h1>Garage Door</h1>
                This door to our garage has needed to be replaced for a while. 
                The old one was falling apart but its a unique size, making a replacement hard to find. 
                So I decided to build one. This door was made to be functional and cheap, so it is far from perfect. 
                It is solid and fits the space pretty well. 
                
            </p>

            <p>
            <img title="Night Stand" src="./images/woodworking/c_stand.jpg" alt="Night Stand Picture">
            <h1>Night Stand</h1>
                We moved some furniture around at Z's parents house, and it meant we needed a very small night stand. 
                I decided to make a "C" shaped stand, so the base could extend under the bed and the top could be within reach. 
                I used a piece of Ambrosia Maple I had laying round and made this piece. 
            </p>

        <p>
            There are also several projects that I have begun working on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A storage shelf for our entry way</li>
            <li>A bed side table</li>
            <li>New microwave trim</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            So please be patient with me as I like to keep quite busy!
