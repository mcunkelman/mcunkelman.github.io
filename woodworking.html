            This page will be dedicated to some of my woodworking projects. 
        </h1>
        <p>
            During the pandemic I began looking for small improvments I could make around the house 
            and that branched into a fun hooby that I have quite enjoyed. 
            I started by making a small cage to keep my dog Archer out of our compost bin, 
            but then I got more tools and have found ways to use them. 
            Some of the projects I have taken on so far are:
        </p>
        <div id="wood">
            <p>
                <img title="Compost Cage" src="./images/woodworking/Compost_Cage.JPG" alt="Compost Cage Picture">
                <h1>Compost Cage</h1>
                    My dog Archer was very interested in the compost bin, so we tried piling brings and stones around it. 
                    He just knocked them over, so I decided to build something sturdier. 
                    This was the simple and quick solution I came up with to keep him out, while allowing us access. 
            </p>

            <img title="Bathroom Cabinet" src="./images/woodworking/Bathroom_Cabinet.JPG" alt="Bathroom Cabinet Picture">
            <h1>Bathroom Cabinet</h1>
                My next project was for Z. She wanted a little cabinet for our first floor half bath. 
                So I designed and built this and hung it on the wall. Its a pine box with poplar doors and top. 
            </p>

            <img title="Solid Cherry Desktop" src="./images/woodworking/Desk.jpg" alt="Desk Picture">
            <h1>Solid Cherry Desktop</h1>
                Working from home had meant that I needed a better desk. Uber allowed me to purchase a sit / stand deskframe,
                but I wanted to make the top myself. I found S3S cherry on sale and used the table saw to finish the boards. 
                I joined them and sanded them smooth, before applying a tung oil finish. Its 5.5 feet long by 31 inches deep.

            <h1>Little Free Library</h1>
                This was a birthday present for Z. 
                She always loved seeing these around the neighborhood, so I decided to make one for her.  
                I spent a lot of time designing this, since it would be loaded with books and have to spport the weight. 
                I alse wanted a see through door, to make it more welcoming. 
                I ended up making the body from pine, and bolting it to the brick wall of the porch. 
                The door is a pine frome with a piece of clear plexiglass for the window. 
            </p>

            There are also several projects that I have begun working on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A new door for our garage <i>(Human door, not car door)</i></li>
            <li>A storage shelf for our entry way</li>
            <li>A bed side table</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            So please be patient with me as I like to keep quite busy!
